# I’m learning Data Structures and Algorithms. Answer the following question using this structured format:

1. ✅ Verify the constraints  
2. 🧪 Write out some test cases  
3. 🔍 Find out a solution without code (brute-force idea)  
4. 🧾 Write out the brute-force solution in JavaScript  
5. ⚡ Write out the optimized solution in JavaScript with clear inline comments explaining each step  
6. 📊 Provide Big O analysis for both time and space complexity  
7. 📚 Mention what algorithm and what technique is being used (e.g. Greedy, Sliding Window, Hashing...)  
8. 💡 Suggest possible variations or follow-up challenges to deepen understanding

# Question:
Paste your question here.

# KEYS for every questions:
Just trying to solve the question by using brute-force answers.
Then you think: Is there any way to optimized the complexity algorithm by using:
- Another Datascture
    + Hash map instead of Array (finding items)
    + Set instead of Array (checking duplicate items) 
    + ...
- Another Algorithm:
    + Binary search instead of Linear search
    + Recursive instead of For Loop
    + ...

- Changing data structure:
    + 🧠 Usually a Time ↔ Space Trade-off

- Changing the algorithm:
    + 🧠 Can Be a Trade-off, But Not Always
